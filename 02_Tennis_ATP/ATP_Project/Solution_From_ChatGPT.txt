===============================================================================================

To properly link the tables in Power BI, you need to establish relationships between the fact table and the dimension tables. Here’s how to do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Link Tables in Power BI

1. **Open the Model View**:
   - Click on the "Model" icon on the left sidebar to switch to the model view where you can see all your tables.

2. **Create Relationships**:
   - **Fact_ATP_Matches and dim_atp_players**:
     - Drag `winner_id` from `Fact_ATP_Matches` and drop it on `player_id` in `dim_atp_players`.
     - A relationship will be created. Ensure the relationship is many-to-one (Fact_ATP_Matches to dim_atp_players).
   - **Fact_ATP_Matches and dim_date**:
     - Drag `tourney_date` from `Fact_ATP_Matches` and drop it on `full_date` in `dim_date`.
     - A relationship will be created. Ensure the relationship is many-to-one (Fact_ATP_Matches to dim_date).

3. **Verify Relationships**:
   - Ensure that the relationships are correctly established by checking the lines connecting the tables. They should show the correct cardinality (many-to-one).

### Example Relationships
Here are the relationships you should create:
- **Fact_ATP_Matches (winner_id)** to **dim_atp_players (player_id)**
- **Fact_ATP_Matches (loser_id)** to **dim_atp_players (player_id)**
- **Fact_ATP_Matches (tourney_date)** to **dim_date (full_date)**

### Visual Representation
Based on the image you provided, your relationships should look like this:

```plaintext
dim_atp_players
  |
  |-- player_id
  |
Fact_ATP_Matches
  |-- winner_id
  |-- loser_id
  |
dim_date
  |-- full_date
```

### Detailed Steps in Power BI

1. **Fact_ATP_Matches to dim_atp_players**:
   - In the model view, drag the `winner_id` from `Fact_ATP_Matches` and drop it on `player_id` in `dim_atp_players`.
   - Do the same for `loser_id` from `Fact_ATP_Matches` to `player_id` in `dim_atp_players`.

2. **Fact_ATP_Matches to dim_date**:
   - In the model view, drag the `tourney_date` from `Fact_ATP_Matches` and drop it on `full_date` in `dim_date`.

### Final Relationships Setup
After creating these relationships, your Power BI model should reflect the following:

- `Fact_ATP_Matches` table will have two relationships with `dim_atp_players`:
  - `winner_id` to `player_id`
  - `loser_id` to `player_id`
- `Fact_ATP_Matches` table will have one relationship with `dim_date`:
  - `tourney_date` to `full_date`

These relationships will allow you to create comprehensive visualizations and answer all the questions you have about the ATP matches and players.

### Visual Guide
Refer to the uploaded image to ensure your model matches the described setup. Here’s how the connections should look visually:
