I've payed an expensive OpenAI/ChatGPT4o subscription to help me work and I'm asking you to reply without any lazyness by following thouroughly my instructions. I'm counting on you to give me all the things I need.

01. Help me accomplish this "ATP project" using the tools I know of and I could use : 
	01. 'SQL Server 2022' with 'T/SQL' requests, as much as possible (no need to go into details for your answers, just give me the complete commented scripts and where/when to execute those).
	02. Powershell into Windows to execute your sql scripts in the terminal ('sqlcmd') 
	03. Planning with Task Scheduling.
	04. Python with Pandas/NumPy...
	05. Excel/PowerBI 
	...
	Make sure to treat/clean the data as much as possible next to the source, ideally in 'T/SQL' / 'Python'.

02. The Data chain or ETL should be as follow (chronological) : 
	-> From CSV Source // atp_matches_qual_chall_xxxx.csv + atp_players.csv + other infos you deem useful to fullfill my requirements
	-> Python script(s) and/or 'T/SQL' script(s) with 'sqlcmd' // From CSV to 'SQL Database'
	-> Powershell script(s) // to execute the previous 'python' and/or 'T/SQL' files to populate the main DB (see next point)
	-> Creation of the main OLTP Database within SQL Server 2022 // 
	-> Python script(s) and/or 'T/SQL' script(s) with 'sqlcmd' // From main DB to DWH DB.
	-> Powershell script(s) // to execute the previous 'python' and/or 'T/SQL' files to populate the main DB (see next point)
	-> Optionnal if you deem it useful : SQL Server 2022 DWH populate (you have to propose a dimensional model if applicable) // 
	-> Power BI for Visualisation // according to business needs you'll find Bellow.

03. Masterdata for the hole project : 
	Project name : "ATP Project"
	Main DB name : 'ATP_0_Main'
	DWH DB name : 'ATP_1_DWH'

			The ATP and the WTA want an app that will enable them to store information about their “business”; more specifically:
				● Create, read, update, delete players’ profile and their coaches’
				● Create, read, update, delete tournaments; a tournament is characterized by
				various information including (but not limited to): the dates, the level, the type
				of court, the draws, the organizers, the tournament director, the referees, the
				umpires, the linesman, the ball boys, the prize money, the sponsors, …
				● (+) Manage the anti-doping testings (https://www.itftennis.com/antidoping/rules/tadp-overview.aspx)
				● (+) Manage the rankings
				● (+) Manage the broadcasting rights

		02.02. Your Tasks
			Business Analysis:
				● Understand (if not known yet) the rules of the game
				● Model the process of tournament organization
				● (+) Model the process of anti-doping testing
			Functional Analysis:
				● Model the Use Case Diagram
				● Model the DB Schema
				● (+) Model the State Chart for the player
========================================================================================================================================================

	03. Business Intelligence
		03.01. Case Study

				Cilic’s US Open victory?
				http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/how-unlikely-was-wawrinkas-australian-open-victory

	Appendix 01 - "00_SourceData" notes : 

		## ATP Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats

		For now, this contains my master ATP player file, plus historical rankings.

		The player file columns are player_id, first_name, last_name, hand, birth_date, country_code.

		The columns for the ranking files are ranking_date, ranking, player_id, ranking_points.

		ATP rankings are mostly complete from 1983 to the end of 2014. 1982 is missing, and rankings from 1973-1981 are only intermittent.


		---

		Update, 24/3/15

		My ATP match result database is now here, as well. There are up to three files per season: One for tour-level main draw matches (e.g. 'atp_matches_2014.csv'), one for tour-level qualifying and challenger main-draw matches, and one for futures matches.

		To make them easier to use, I've included a fair bit of redundancy with the biographical and ranking files: each row contains several columns of biographical information, along with ranking and ranking points, for both players. Ranking data, as well as age, are as of tourney_date, which is almost always the Monday at or near the beginning of the event.

		MatchStats are included where I have them. In general, that means 1991-present for tour-level matches, 2008-present for challengers, and 2011-present for tour-level qualifying. The MatchStats columns should be self-explanatory, but they might not be what you're used to seeing; it's all integer totals (e.g. 1st serves in, not 1st serve percentage), from which traditional percentages can be calculated.

		There are a few tour-level matches with missing stats. Some are missing because ATP doesn't have them. Others I've deleted because they didn't pass some sanity check (loser won 60% of points, or match time was under 20 minutes, etc). Also, Davis Cup matches are included in the tour-level files, but there are no stats for Davis Cup matches

		---

		Update, 8/4/15

		2015 rankings, results, and stats are now available through last week's play. The results files are named according to the same conventions as the others. The rankings file for the current year is atp_rankings_current.csv.
