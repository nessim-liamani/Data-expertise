## Guide: Government Formation Process – Past, Present, and Future

### How Government Formation Works Today

In Belgium, forming a government after an election is a complex and often lengthy process that involves several steps:

- **Initial Designations:**  
  After an election, the party with the most seats typically takes the lead in the government formation process. An "informer" is first appointed to gather insights from all parties, and then a "formateur" is designated—usually from the leading party—to spearhead coalition negotiations.

- **Coalition Negotiations:**  
  Political parties engage in intensive and sometimes prolonged negotiations. Their goal is to form a coalition that meets certain essential criteria:
  - **Seat Threshold:** The coalition must control at least a minimum number of seats (e.g., 76 seats).
  - **Community Balance:** The coalition should reflect the linguistic and regional diversity of the country (e.g., ensuring representation from both Flemish and Francophone communities).

- **Ministerial Appointments:**  
  Once a coalition agreement is reached, ministerial portfolios (such as Finance, Foreign Affairs, etc.) are allocated among the coalition partners. This distribution is often subject to political bargaining rather than a fixed set of rules.

- **Confidence Vote:**  
  Finally, the newly formed government must secure a vote of confidence in Parliament. If the vote fails or if negotiations stall, caretaker governments may be formed, or the entire process might be restarted.

This traditional process relies heavily on human judgment and negotiation, which can lead to delays, subjective decision-making, and sometimes prolonged periods of interim (caretaker) governance.

### How It Should Be

The ideal system for government formation should be:

- **Transparent and Predictable:**  
  Every step in the process—from initial designations to the final confidence vote—should be clearly defined, with explicit deadlines that everyone understands.

- **Rule-Based and Automated:**  
  Decisions should be guided by objective, predetermined rules rather than subjective negotiations. For example, instead of lengthy debates over who should be the formateur, the system would automatically designate the party with the most seats, with clear fallback procedures if negotiations fail.

- **Efficient:**  
  Strict time limits ensure that government formation happens swiftly, minimizing the time spent in caretaker mode and ensuring a stable government is in place soon after an election.

- **Fair and Representative:**  
  The resulting government should accurately reflect the election results, both in terms of seat share and community representation. Ministerial roles and responsibilities should be distributed based on objective criteria, such as party size and the strategic importance of the ministry.

### How We Implemented It

Our project demonstrates a digital, rule-based simulation of the government formation process. Here’s a brief overview of how each component of our implementation corresponds to the ideal system:

- **Election Data Module:**  
  We begin by clearly publishing the election results. This module displays all participating parties, their seat counts, and their community affiliations in a transparent manner.

- **Coalition Calculator Module:**  
  This module automatically computes all possible coalitions that meet the minimum seat requirement and ensure community balance. It then ranks these coalitions based on a stability metric (i.e., how closely they meet the minimum threshold).

- **Government Formation Module:**  
  - **Designating the Formateur:**  
    Instead of a subjective decision, our system automatically designates the party with the most seats as the formateur. If negotiations fail, the next highest party is considered.
  - **Negotiation Simulation:**  
    The process of forming a coalition is simulated within a fixed time frame (e.g., 90 days). Our system uses objective rules and a controlled probability to decide if negotiations succeed.
  - **Confidence Vote:**  
    Once a coalition is agreed upon, a simulated confidence vote is conducted. This ensures that the government is only finalized if it meets the predetermined criteria.

- **Portfolio Allocation Module:**  
  Ministerial portfolios are distributed among coalition parties in a transparent, proportional manner. This allocation is based on each party’s seat share and the relative importance of the ministries.

- **Interim Government and Sanctions Modules:**  
  If the coalition formation process exceeds the allowed time, an interim (caretaker) government is automatically formed using a pre-approved list of technocrats. Additionally, the system enforces sanctions (e.g., financial penalties) against parties that delay the process, ensuring strict adherence to deadlines.

### In Summary

Our implementation transforms the traditional, negotiation-heavy process of government formation into a clear, objective, and automated procedure. By applying predetermined rules and deadlines, we aim to reduce uncertainty and political maneuvering while ensuring that the final government is both stable and truly representative of the electorate’s will.

This guide is intended to help non-technical readers understand both the challenges of the current system and the benefits of our proposed, digitally assisted, rule-based approach.

## Algorithmic Government Formation Protocol (AGFP)

This repository contains a Python implementation of an "Algorithmic Government Formation Protocol" (AGFP), a simulated rule-based government formation process inspired by the Belgian government formation process. The project demonstrates a modular design for automating and simulating various steps including:
- Election data publication
- Coalition computation and ranking
- Government formation (with negotiation and confidence vote simulation)
- Ministerial portfolio allocation
- Interim (caretaker) government formation
- Sanctions enforcement for non-compliance
