### Project Plan for "Projet Police"

#### 1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - **Theme**: Analyzing police shootings in the U.S. to identify potential discrimination and patterns.
   - **Context**: There is a significant concern about police shootings, especially involving ethnic minorities.
   - **Objective**: Create a comprehensive data solution to analyze and report on police shootings, addressing key questions on ethnic discrimination, regional differences, temporal trends, and police misconduct.

#### 2. **Data Sources**
   - **Primary Data**: 
     - `fatal-police-shootings.csv`: Details on police shootings.
     - `Ethnicity Data USA.xlsx`: Ethnic distribution in the U.S.
     - `uscities.csv`: Information about U.S. cities.
     - `fatal-police-shootings-agencies.xlsx`: Agencies involved in shootings.
   - **Additional Data**: Other relevant datasets as needed for further analysis.

#### 3. **Administrative Objectives**

     - Model the use case diagram for understanding interactions.
     - Design the database schema for OLTP and OLAP systems.
   - **Project Management**
     - **Deliverables and Tasks**: Identify tasks, assign responsibilities, and estimate time required.
     - **Critical Path**: Determine the sequence of essential tasks.
     - **Resource Allocation**: Assign team members to tasks.
     - **Risk Management**: Identify and plan for potential risks.

#### 4. **Technical Objectives**

     - **OLTP**: Build `Police_0_Main` for initial data storage.
     - **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess data using Python and T/SQL.
     - **OLAP**: Build `Police_1_DWH` using a star schema for analytical queries.
   - **ETL Process**
     - Develop ETL scripts using Python, T/SQL, and Powershell.
     - Schedule regular ETL tasks using Windows Task Scheduler.
   - **Visualization and Reporting**
     - Utilize Power BI to create interactive reports and dashboards.

#### 5. **Key Questions to Address**
	### 1. **Global Situation**: Analyze overall trends in police shootings.
		1. **What is the annual number of fatal police shootings in the United States from 2015 to 2022?**
		   - This question aims to identify the yearly trend and check if the number of incidents is increasing or decreasing over the years.

		2. **What are the most common circumstances (e.g., manner of death, armed status) under which police shootings occur?**
		   - This helps in understanding the typical scenarios of these incidents, such as whether the victims were armed and the common manners of death (e.g., shot, Tasered).

		3. **What is the demographic profile (age, gender, race) of individuals involved in police shootings?**
		   - This question seeks to paint a comprehensive picture of the victims, highlighting any prevalent patterns in demographics.

	### 2. **Ethnic Discrimination**: Determine if certain ethnic groups are disproportionately affected.
		1. **What is the rate of fatal police shootings per 100,000 people for each ethnic group?**
		   - By normalizing the data with population size, we can assess if certain ethnic groups face a higher risk of being involved in police shootings.

		2. **How do the characteristics of police shootings (e.g., armed status, threat level) differ between ethnic groups?**
		   - This question examines whether there are differences in the nature of incidents involving different ethnicities, such as whether certain groups are more likely to be unarmed or perceived as a threat.

		3. **What proportion of the total police shootings does each ethnic group represent, and how does this compare to their proportion of the total population?**
		   - This comparison helps to identify any disproportionate representation in police shootings relative to their population size.

	### 3. **Regional Differences**: Compare shootings across different U.S. regions.
		1. **Which states or regions have the highest and lowest rates of fatal police shootings?**
		   - This identifies geographic hotspots and safer areas, facilitating a regional comparison.

		2. **Comparison of police shootings by state, focusing on the number of shootings involving unarmed individuals**
		   - This query provides a comparison of police shootings by state, focusing on the total number of shootings and how many of them involved unarmed individuals.

		3. **What are the characteristics of police shootings (e.g., armed status, threat level) in different regions of the United States?**
		   - This question explores regional variations in the nature of police shootings, such as whether certain areas have higher incidents involving unarmed individuals.

	### 4. **Temporal Evolution**: Identify trends over time.
		1. **How has the number of fatal police shootings changed annually from 2015 to 2022?**
		   - This provides a year-by-year trend analysis to see if incidents are increasing or decreasing.

		2. **What are the trends in police shootings for different ethnic groups over time?**
		   - This looks at whether the risk for specific ethnic groups has changed over the years.

		3. **Are there seasonal or monthly patterns in the occurrence of fatal police shootings?**
		   - This helps to identify if there are specific times of the year when incidents are more frequent.

	### 5. **Police Misconduct**: Assess the extent of police misconduct.
		1. **What percentage of fatal police shootings involve victims who were unarmed at the time of the incident?**
		   - This metric is crucial for assessing potential cases of misconduct where lethal force might not have been justified.

		2. **How many incidents involve officers who had their body cameras turned off or malfunctioning during the shooting?**
		   - This question focuses on accountability and transparency issues within the police force.

		3. **What is the frequency of fatal police shootings involving signs of mental illness, and how are these incidents handled compared to others?**
		   - This examines if there is a different protocol or outcome for incidents involving individuals with mental health issues, indicating potential areas for policy improvement.

	These questions provide a structured approach to analyzing the data, ensuring that each aspect of the problem is thoroughly investigated.

#### 6. **Detailed Plan and Steps**

	##### **1. Analysis and Design**
		- **Use Case Diagram**: Define interactions between the system and users (DOJ analysts, data engineers).
		- **Database Schema**: 
		  - Design schemas for `Police_0_Main` and `Police_1_DWH`.

	##### **2. Data Preparation**
		- **Data Import and Cleaning**:
		  - Write Python scripts to load and clean data from CSV/Excel files.
		  - Use T/SQL scripts for further cleaning and integrity checks.
		- **Example Python Script (ETL_00_from_files_to_DB.py)**:
		  ```python

		  ```

	##### **3. Data Warehouse Setup**
		- **Schema Design**: Define fact and dimension tables for star schema.
		- **DDL Scripts**:
		  ```sql

		  ```

	##### **4. ETL Development**
		- **Python Script for ETL Process (ETL_01_from_DB_to_DWH.py)**:
		  ```python

		  ```

	##### **5. Visualization with Power BI**
		- **Connect Power BI to `Police_1_DWH`**.
		- **Create Reports and Dashboards**:
		  - **Global Trends**: Line chart showing trends over years.
		  - **Ethnic Discrimination**: Bar chart comparing shooting rates by ethnicity.
		  - **Regional Analysis**: Map visualization showing shootings by state.
		  - **Temporal Trends**: Line chart showing shootings over time.
		  - **Police Misconduct**: KPI indicators for signs of police misconduct.

	##### **6. Documentation and Reporting**
		- **Project Report**:
		  - Methodology
		  - Data sources and preparation
		  - Analysis and findings
		  - Visualizations and insights
		- **Backup of Data Warehouse**: Provide a full backup of the `Police_1_DWH` database.
		- **Source Code**: All scripts used for ETL and database management.

By following this structured plan, the project will systematically address the key objectives and deliver comprehensive insights into the police shootings across the United States.
